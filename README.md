# NLTKProject
Final Project of Natural Language Processing with NLTK, Computational Linguistic Course

# About 
The project consists in the textual analysis, using Python and NLTK library, of the speeches made by Joe Biden and Donald Trump in the US elections on November 2, 2020.

# Using
<code> Python3 </code>

<code> NLTK Lib </code>

# Info

Inside the project you can find 2 corpora of the speechs:
<ul>
  <li><code>biden.txt</code></li>  (Biden's speechs)
 
  <li><code>trumpt.txt</code></li>  (Trump's speechs)
  </ul>
  
  There are two </code>Python</code> programs which analyse these corpora:
  <ul>
  <li><code>ProgettoBaccheschi599107.py</code></li>  
 
  <li><code>ProgettoBaccheschi599107Secondo.py</code></li>  
  </ul>
  
To launch the two programs, in your console type following:

<pre>#the program 1
python3 ProgettoBaccheschi599107.py biden.txt trumpt.txt</pre>

<pre>#the program 2
python3 ProgettoBaccheschi599107Secondo.py biden.txt trumpt.txt</pre>

  
# Example

You can find sample outputs in 

<ul>
  <li><code>output.txt</code>   (about first program) </li>    
 
  <li><code>output2.txt</code>  (about second program) </li>  
  </ul>
